# C++ for Pythonians

CPP is hard, but worth it. CPP is a compiled language. It is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. This makes it faster than Python, which is an interpreted language.
CPP is older than Python and evolved over time. In addition, some features are compatible with even older versions of C. This makes it a very powerful language, but also a bit more complex to learn.
If you thought Python 2 -> 3 was a mess, wait until you see C++98 -> C++11 -> C++14 -> C++17 -> C++20 -> C++23 -> C++26.
The language has evolved a lot over the years, and the latest versions have a lot of features that make it easier to write code.
At the time of writing, C++23 seems to be the latest, stable-enough version. C++26 is in the works, but it will take some time before it is widely adopted.


*. Learn new C++ (e.g. C++23) features. Forget the old ways when you can.
*. Dont collide namespaces. Use `using namespace std;` only in small programs. For larger programs, use `std::` prefix instead of colliding namespaces.
*. Use `auto` keyword to let the compiler deduce the type of the variable. This makes the code more readable and less error-prone
*. Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or `0`. `nullptr` is a pointer literal that can be converted to any pointer type.
*. Use modern memory management techniques like `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr` instead of raw pointers.
*. Use `std::generator` instead of raw iterators. Beware, you cannot create a generator on one thread and use it from another thread. Create and use it on the same thread whenever possible.
*. Learn about lvalue and rvalue.
*. Careful while reusing variable names. Sometimes, it can lead to unexpected results. Example, the caller of one function may have bound the variable name to a reference, and the callee may change the reference to point to a different object.
*. Dont put functional code in assert statements. They may be removed in release builds.
  It maybe okay  `assert do_work() == STATUS_OK, "Work Failed"` in python, but not in C++.
*. `gdb` (or such debuggers) is your friend. Learn to use it. It can be a bit intimidating at first, but it is a very powerful tool. 
  If your program crashes, `gdb --args ./build/myprogram arg1 arg2` will help you find the problem. Look for GDB cheat sheets online.
  useful shortcuits: `bt` (backtrace), `p var` (print variable), `c` (continue), `n` (next), `s` (step), `q` (quit). `info locals` (print local variables), `info args` (print function arguments).

*. Debugging libtorch code can also be intimidating at first. But, it is worth learning. Some useful tips:
  * `p tensor.print()` to print the tensor type and shape.
  * ``ptensor tensor`` to print the tensor values, where ptensor is a user-defined command in `.gdbinit` file at the root of the project. gdb might not load the `.gdbinit` file by default due to security reasons. Look for warnings when you start gdb. One fix is to add the following line to your gdbinit file: `add-auto-load-safe-path /`.
